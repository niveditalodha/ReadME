While SAS is still widely respected and used across corporations because of its efficiency and support availability, Python is increasingly becoming the language of choice owing to its open source nature and rapid development of machine learning and artificial intelligence libraries. I have extensively worked with both the languages and often times get asked if there is easy guidance for people who know SAS to be able to easily transition to Python.

Energy is of paramount importance when it comes to deep learning model deployment especially at the edge. There is a great blog post on why energy matters for AI@Edge by Pete Warden on “Why the future of Machine Learning is Tiny”. Energy optimizations for programs (or models) can only be done with a good understanding of the underlying computations. Over the last few years of working with deep learning folks — hardware architects, micro-kernel coders, model developers, platform programmers, and interviewees (especially interviewees) I have discovered that people understand LSTMs from a qualitative perspective but not well from a quantitative position. If you don’t understand something well you would not be able to optimize it. This lack of understanding has contributed to the LSTMs starting to fall out of favor. This tutorial tries to bridge that gap between the qualitative and quantitative by explaining the computations required by LSTMs through the equations. Also, this is a way for me to consolidate my understanding of LSTM from a computational perspective. Hopefully, it would also be useful to other people working with LSTMs in different capacities.","Lstm,Deep Learning,Machine Learning,Interview,Artificial Intelligence",56.jpg,5,18,Towards Data Science,2020-04-06

Back then, only when they were frequently exposed to the jobs, did they gain more information as well as experience since they barely found additional sources of information which they could quickly learn from. These experts thus became a valuable asset to the company and no one could replace their roles. Being specialised in one thing was their unique values and hence it helped secure their job as well as ensure a thriving career.

An entire field has been dedicated to improving this selection process; it is referred to as hyperparameter optimization (HPO). Inherently, HPO requires testing many different hyperparameter configurations and as a result can benefit tremendously from massively parallel resources like the Perlmutter system we are building at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC). As we prepare for Perlmutter, we wanted to explore the multitude of HPO frameworks and strategies that exist on a model of interest.

Implicit bias in machine learning has very real consequences including denial of a loan, a lengthier prison sentence, and many other harmful outcomes for underprivileged groups. The data scientists designing models and the computers running them may not be explicitly biased against a particular group, so how does bias enter the picture? Whether it is along lines of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or other forms of identification there are correlations between groups and factors contributing to unfavorable outcomes.

Why the p-value should not be overrated.</strong>",,"Have you ever heard somebody say that a study revealed „significant results“? What does that even mean? Let me introduce you to a practice in the scientific industry that is deeply debated and still used to answer research questions. Simply put, it roughly goes like this: If you run a model and your computer gives you a p less than .05, your results have reached the holy grail of being statistically significant and therefore are more likely to be published. On the other hand, if p is over .05, your observations do not seem to deviate from what was already known. However, this is probably a dangerous way of going about making conclusions from data and arouses the temptation to use this tool almost mechanically. This practice is so hotly discussed, that the American Statistical Association (ASA) published a statement regarding p-values to shed some light on the issue (Wasserstein & Lazar, 2016). Some experts even go this far saying that the p-value is the reason why most research findings are false (Ioannidis, 2018) and make its misuse responsible for a reproducibility crisis in research (Peng, 2015). There is a whole guide to misinterpretations around this concept because the p-value is far from being intuitive, foolproof and straightforward (Greenland et al., 2016) — for amateurs as well as researchers. Thus, it is worth getting a grasp of the underlying concept. Therefore, I would like to give a you a gentle and basic introduction to the most famous and yet most confusing concept in statistics: null hypothesis significance testing.","P Value,Data Science,Statistics,Hypothesis Testing,Editors Pick",307.jpeg,0,12,Towards Data Science,2020-09-02

Well then You Need Hard-To-Find Data,,"Algorithmic trading, using either news or stock signals, has blossomed in popularity over recent years. An entire industry has developed from giants like Bloomberg and Webhose, to thousands of smaller companies all vying to have the fastest, most accurate, and most expansive news coverage. The problem with most of these services, however, is they are targeting large firms, and therefore often cost hundreds to an individual, most likely pricing themselves out of most people’s algorithms, and at the very least eating away at potential returns. For this reason, I decided to try and piece together the most realistic solution for the at-home developers, and after exploring dozens of sources, I have narrowed my search down to the 10 most viable options. None of these 10 free sources provide a home run for algorithmic trading, but it's quite realistic to think that a combination of these sources can get most people to a great place! In part 1, I will be covering the first 5, which are all APIs!

One of the earliest examples was a widely circulated draft study from Stanford University. The authors of the study estimated the likely prevalence of antibodies amongst a population of 3,300 test subjects in Santa Clara county (California) to be 1.5%, though they also accepted an uncertainty that would purport to place the true prevalence within a range of 1.11 to 1.97% (with 95% confidence). This article explains how consideration of well-known statistical and machine learning concepts for handling uncertainty and observed data, specifically Bayes’ Theorem, would have more realistically estimated the true prevalence to lay within a considerably larger range of 0.2% to 2.1% (95% credible). As has been critiqued by other scientists, a more careful consideration of uncertainty by the Stanford study’s authors might have avoided the over-sensationalisation of the study’s initial findings if such a wide error would have been originally identified.","Bayesian Statistics,Uncertainty,Covid 19,Inference",428.png,0,19,Towards Data Science,2020-05-05

A model has more interpretability than another one if its decisions are easier for a human to comprehend. Some models are so complex and are internally structured in such a way that it’s almost impossible to understand how they reached their final results. These black boxes seem to break the association between raw data and final output, since several processes happen in between.","Data Science,Machine Learning,Programming,Python,Linear Regression",467.jpg,0,16,Towards Data Science,2020-09-08

Many in Generation X and Millennials saw their accumulated equity vanish. Those close to or in retirement witnessed one of their most trusted assets, their property, fall off a precipice. Across all age groups, people suffered financial difficulties. Those were able to afford a new property or retain owned assets saw substantial gains in the last decade, not only recovering to pre-crash highs but in some areas doubling or even tripling in value. Meanwhile, a perfect storm of debt, a dwindling number early career jobs that pay a livable wage, and increases to costs of living have changed the homeownership prospects for many. A recent analysis found a 52% majority of 18–29 year olds are living with their parents, which may be partially attributed to confluence of higher education being remote, the continued rise of remote work, and large layoffs across different industries. In this article, I will demonstrate how the percentage of owner occupancy and renting has changed between 2010–2018 in different age groups and generational categories.
